## Problem statement

AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in computer hardware and peripheral manufacturing, operates multiple branches across India. The sales director is struggling to assess business performance and identify the challenges behind the company's declining sales. Whenever he reaches out to regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, he faces difficulties as they find it challenging to interpret raw data from Excel files. This lack of clarity and data accessibility has become a major source of frustration.


## Scope

Developing a dashboard that offers comprehensive insights into revenue generation across different cities over various time periods, highlights the top five customers and top five products, and provides data on the quantity of hardware sold to each customer.
